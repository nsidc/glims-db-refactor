I am using the shapely python library to create polygons with holes, and I want to put these into a PostGIS table. But currently, when I do this, I get errors: "non close ring detected", and "holes are nested". What's the best way to ensure correct topology and insert into PostGIS?




2.0 Flash Experimental. Might not work as expected.
You're encountering common issues when working with complex geometries and spatial databases. Here's a breakdown of the problems and a robust solution using Shapely and PostGIS:

Understanding the Errors:

"Non-closed ring detected": This means the linestrings defining your polygons (both exterior and interior rings/holes) don't start and end at the same coordinates. Polygons must be closed.
"Holes are nested": This means a hole is inside another hole, which is topologically invalid. Holes must be within the exterior ring but not within each other.
Solution: Using shapely.validation.make_valid and careful construction:

The most reliable approach is to use Shapely's make_valid function before inserting into PostGIS. This function attempts to fix invalid geometries. Here's a comprehensive strategy:

Python

from shapely.geometry import Polygon, MultiPolygon
from shapely.validation import make_valid
import psycopg2  # Or your preferred PostgreSQL adapter

def insert_polygon_to_postgis(conn, polygon, table_name, srid=4326):
    """Inserts a Shapely polygon into a PostGIS table, handling validation."""
    if not polygon.is_valid:
        print("Geometry was invalid. Attempting to make it valid.")
        polygon = make_valid(polygon)
        if not polygon.is_valid:
            raise ValueError("Geometry could not be made valid.")

    if polygon.geom_type == 'Polygon':
        # Convert to WKB hex
        wkb_hex = polygon.wkb_hex
        sql = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} (geom) VALUES (ST_GeomFromWKB(decode('{wkb_hex}', 'hex'), {srid}))"
    elif polygon.geom_type == 'MultiPolygon':
        for geom in polygon.geoms:
            wkb_hex = geom.wkb_hex
            sql = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} (geom) VALUES (ST_GeomFromWKB(decode('{wkb_hex}', 'hex'), {srid}))"
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Geometry type {polygon.geom_type} not supported.")
    try:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute(sql)
        conn.commit()
    except psycopg2.Error as e:
        conn.rollback()
        raise e


# Example Usage:
try:
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=your_db user=your_user password=your_password host=your_host")

    # Example of a polygon with a hole (make sure it's constructed correctly!)
    exterior = [(0, 0), (0, 10), (10, 10), (10, 0), (0, 0)]
    hole = [(2, 2), (2, 8), (8, 8), (8, 2), (2, 2)]
    polygon_with_hole = Polygon(exterior, [hole])

    insert_polygon_to_postgis(conn, polygon_with_hole, "your_table")

    # Example of a self-intersecting polygon that make_valid will correct
    invalid_exterior = [(0, 0), (10, 10), (0, 10), (10, 0), (0,0)]
    invalid_polygon = Polygon(invalid_exterior)
    insert_polygon_to_postgis(conn, invalid_polygon, "your_table")


    print("Polygon inserted successfully.")

except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error while inserting polygon:", error)
finally:
    if conn:
        conn.close()

Key Improvements:

make_valid(): This is the crucial step. It handles most topological issues, including self-intersections, non-closed rings, and nested holes (by dissolving them).
WKB Hex: Using polygon.wkb_hex and ST_GeomFromWKB is the most reliable way to transfer geometries to PostGIS.
Error Handling: The try...except blocks with conn.rollback() are essential for robust database interactions.
Multipolygon Handling: The code now correctly handles multipolygons, which can result from make_valid correcting certain invalid geometries.
Clearer Function and Example: The code is organized into a reusable function and provides a clear example of usage, including creating a polygon with a hole.
SRID Parameter: The function now accepts an SRID (Spatial Reference Identifier) to ensure correct spatial referencing in PostGIS.
Important Considerations:

Construction: Double-check how you're creating your polygons in Shapely. Ensure the coordinates of the first and last points of each ring are identical.
Debugging: If make_valid fails, examine the original geometry closely using print(polygon.wkt) (Well-Known Text) or visualize it with tools like GeoJSON.io to pinpoint the exact problem.
PostGIS Configuration: Make sure PostGIS is correctly installed and enabled in your PostgreSQL database.
By implementing these changes, you should be able to reliably insert complex polygons with holes into your PostGIS table. If you still encounter issues, provide a minimal reproducible example of your polygon creation code, and I can assist further.
